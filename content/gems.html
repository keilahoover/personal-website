        <!-- What is it?
        Four team members and myself built and designed an eCommerce collectibles website using the Craigslist API.

        Problem Solved:
        Many of us love walking in to an antique or vintage shop, but how convenient it would be if we could find antiques, vintage, and collectible items online? Gems brings our antiques to our fingertips, and possibly in our hands that day!

        Future Ideas:
        UX Research shows that antique collectors are seeking a way to identify their items. (Reddit, 2018)  Therefore I would like to eventually add a community that can use AR so avid collectors can ask others if they can identify what the item they own may be.

        Persona:

        Pete
        -Galvanize Instructor
        As a collector, I want to be able to simply find that specific item I have been looking for, in my area.

        Pete is in his mid-30â€™s who lives a minimal but stimulating lifestyle who is an avid collector particularly of video games and consoles. He enjoys searching brick and mortar antique/collectible shops. However, the convenience of finding items online would help save time in his busy life as an instructor and freelance full-stack developer. He also wants to find a community that seeks finding and selling those gems.
