        <!-- What is it: I had the privilege of working with, Kindara, a company with a mission to offer women the tools, knowledge, and support to understand how their fertility works, take ownership of their reproductive health, and meet their fertility goals.

        I reached out to the Kindara team to work together in adding awareness around a health condition that affects over 200 million women worldwide, Endometriosis. I also felt it prudent to add symptom data tracking to keep up with their competitors and to over all enhance UX.

        Add features:
        - Symptoms Data Tracking
        - Symptoms Reminder
        - Endometriosis Community
        - Endometriosis Awareness Building Features

        Collaboration:
        James Gardner | CTO of Kindara

        Problem Solved:
        Customer Retention
        By adding Endometriosis Awareness Features to the Kindara app, existing and new user alike will be able to understand their bodies even better, and create a community to support each other.

        Sales
        Adding Symptom tracking before the custom data will increase a chance of leading the user to upgrade to a subscription.



        Persona:
        Woman 25-40 year old who wants to understand her body better, and enjoys being in the community and up to date with womenâ€™s health.

        She wants to be able to easily add and update data on her own health to staying healthy and possibly get pregnant or prevent pregnancy. Whichever path she seeks, she keeps coming back to the Kindara app because she seeks to become a healthier self where she can reach out to other women who have been through similar situations for support.
